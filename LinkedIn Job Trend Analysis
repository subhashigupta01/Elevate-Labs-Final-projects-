<>br 
Subhashi Gupta 
As the global data landscape continues to evolve, staying informed about industry hiring trends has become crucial for professionals and organizations alike. In this project, I explored and visualized recent hiring activity for data-related roles using a dataset of LinkedIn job postings, specifically from April to May 2025. The goal was to uncover patterns in demand, identify the most sought-after roles, and highlight key employers in the data space.



## Data Overview
The dataset—LinkedIn Data Jobs Dataset—was scraped from LinkedIn and includes job postings for various data roles such as:


Data Analyst
Data Scientist
Data Engineer
Machine Learning Engineer
AI/ML Engineer
Product Analytics Specialists
Junior and Senior positions in data-related fields
Before diving into Power BI, I ensured the data was clean and ready for analysis. This involved checking for missing values and duplicate records, both of which were not present in the dataset.



Data Modeling in Power BI
Once imported into Power BI, I created a custom Date Table using DAX function and extended it with ADDCOLUMNS() to include year, month, and day fields. This enabled accurate time-based aggregations and comparisons across weeks and months.

I also created several measures using DAX, including:


Total Listings
Count of Distinct Roles
Count of Hiring Companies
Weekly distribution of job postings
Monthly and daily trends


Key Findings
Overall Summary


Total Listings: 618 job postings were recorded over the two-month period.
Unique Roles: 279 distinct job titles were identified.
Hiring Companies: 375 different companies posted job openings.


Most In-Demand Roles

The most frequently posted positions include:


Data Analyst – 93 postings
Data Scientist – 58 postings
Data Engineer – 52 postings
Product Analytics Roles (both Scientist and Engineer) – 47 postings combined
Machine Learning Engineer – 14 postings
Junior and AI/ML Roles – 22 postings
These numbers indicate strong demand for professionals skilled in analytics, engineering, and machine learning.
